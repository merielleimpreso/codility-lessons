A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.<br/>

Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.<br/>

Write a function:<br/>

    int solution(int X, int Y, int D);

that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.<br/>

For example, given:<br/>

    X = 10
    Y = 85
    D = 30
the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:<br/>

after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40<br/>
after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70<br/>
after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100<br/>
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:<br/>

- [x] X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
- [x] X â‰¤ Y.
