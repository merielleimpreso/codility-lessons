An array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.<br/>

Your goal is to find that missing element.<br/>

Write a function:<br/>

    function solution(A);<br/>

    that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.<br/>

For example, given array A such that:<br/>

    A[0] = 2<br/>
    A[1] = 3<br/>
    A[2] = 1<br/>
    A[3] = 5<br/>
the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.<br/>

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:<br/>

- [x] N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
- [x] the elements of A are all distinct;
- [x] each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].
